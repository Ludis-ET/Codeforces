============ 12 =============================
the program calculates and displays the income taxof a salary entered from the keyboard
so before everything we accept the salary from the user 
there is a tax range that the question gave us 
    Range Rate
    Up to 200Br 0%
    200Br – 600Br 10%
    1200Br – 2000Br 15%
    2000Br – 3500Br 25%
    3500Br & above 30%
so we check if the salary entered from the user is in between them and calculate the tax
after we finished calculating the tax we pronts it to the user 


============ 13 ========================

we want a program that tells the number of days found in the months of aEuropeancalendar

so we accept month and year from the user then we check if the given month is in between 1 and 12 otherwise it's invalid

but there are special caeses in gregorean caledar 
for the month 1, 3, 5, 7,8 , 10, 13 the days are 31
for the month 4, 6, 9, 11 the days are 30
for the month 2 the days are 28 or 29 we know that by checking if the given year is leap or not
then we display the days in that month and year to the user 


================= 14 ===================
we want a program that computes and displays the next date of a European calendar date entered from the keyboard

so we accept day, month and year from the user then we check if the given month is in between 1 and 12 otherwise it's invalid

but there are special caeses in gregorean caledar 
for the month 1, 3, 5, 7,8 , 10, 13 the days are 31
for the month 4, 6, 9, 11 the days are 30
for the month 2 the days are 28 or 29 we know that by checking if the given year is leap or not

then to display the next day we add one to the days in the month but we have to check something


we have to validate the day entered from the user like if they say 31 / 4/ 2000 we know that in month 4 we only have 30 days so it's invalid
after checking that we also check if the entered day is equal to the month day that means for example if we entered 30/4/2000 if we add one it goes to the next month instead of becoming 31

so if the entered day is from 1 to days in the month (30, 31, 29, 28) we just add 1
if the entered day is equal to the month day we add 1 to the month and set the next month like 30/4/2000 -> 1/5/2000
if the entered year is 12 we change the year like 31/12/2000 -> 1/1/2001
